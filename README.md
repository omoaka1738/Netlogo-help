Modelling robust and secure utility grids in dense urban environments

As civilisation becomes ever more complex and dependent on technology we also become more and more dependent on the infrastructure that underpins this. This project will consider the following networks:

 

·         Transport (roads, rail etc)

·         Electricity grid

·         Water network

·         Sewerage network

·         Telecommunications (wired, fibre, transmission)

·         Computer systems that control all of the above

 

and consider the weak points of such systems. The ultimate aim is to produce a model of a simplified urban environment that is structured in such a way as to be robust to the ‘interruption’ of these networks and evaluate how effective/secure different network setups are.
